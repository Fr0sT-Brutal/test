Fork of VirtualTreeview repo located at http://virtual-treeview.googlecode.com/ with several modifications:

1. Zebra line painting (odd and even lines could be filled with different background color)
   Added: toZebraLines value to TVTPaintOption
          OddLineColor, EvenLineColor fields to TVTColors
2. Allow header resizing/dragging in design time.

Modifications are surrounded with `Fr0sT_mod` define and could be easily switched off by commenting `{$DEFINE Fr0sT_mod}` line.

**Each modification resides within its personal branch named `fr0st_%mod_code%` so that they could be merged independently.**
Branch `fr0st_mod` integrates all the modifications together.
